# When artists are trying to keep a daily or regular art practice or
# challenge, it is hard to start from a blank canvas.
#
# We are often more creative when provided with art prompts.
#
# Write a art prompt generator for artists.
# The tool will generate 3 prompts for the user each time it's run.
#
# TIP:
#
# Your prompt list is going to be rather long. So make sure that you
# keep your lines under 79 characters while remaining legible with the
# right indents. A list can be separated into multiple lines as long as
# it starts with a [ and ends with a ].
#
# e.g.
# greetings = ['hi', 'hello',
#              'bonjour', 'konnichiwa']
